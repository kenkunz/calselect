extract to CalSelect.Base:

- hmm...


CalSelect responsibilities:

- takes date field as arg
- adds observers to date field (focus, pseudo-blur)
- inserts calendar, binds date:clicked observer
- shows calendar (update with CalPage), binds listener to document click
- hides
- gets/sets date from field


CalSelect.RangeSelector responsibilities:

- take two date fields as args
- add observers to date fields ?
- insert range wrapper element, bind observer to 'close' button
- shows calendar (update w/ 2 CalPage instances), bind listener to document click
- hides
- gets/sets dates?



Range Selector (CalSelect.Range)
- binds "opener" onto both start/end date fields
- binds "closer" onto "close (x)" and document click
- creates two calendars, one each for start/end dates (date getter/setter)
- creates linkage between calendars:
  * setting start causes end month to advance (if needed)
  * setting end causes start month to retreat (if needed)
  * what about highlighting range??? does each calendar need to know about
    the other's date?? or the range selector calls a method on each calendar
    with date range to tell it to highlight? perhaps selectRange/selectedRange?

Basic Selector (CalSelect.Base)
- binds "opener" onto date field
- binds "closer" onto "date:clicked" and document click
