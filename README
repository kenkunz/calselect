CalSelect is a JavaScript calendar date selection widget, built on top of
the Prototype JS framework.

Usage:

  Include prototype.js (tested with 1.6.0.3), date_extensions.js, and
  cal_select.js. You can use cal_select.css for vanilla styling, or create
  your own stylesheet.
  
  A CalSelect instance is instantiated by passing the DOM id or or actual
  DOM element of a form text input field:
  
  new CalSelect('date_field');


Known Issues:

- month-pager only works in FF2! (broken in FF3 and Safari, unknown for
  other browsers)
- field observer test only passes in Firefox due to how keydown event is
  being simulated


To Do:

- fix paging!
- fix field observer test to be cross-browser
- use Ersatz for JS mocking
- create a date-range selection widget
